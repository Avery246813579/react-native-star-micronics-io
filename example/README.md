# React Native Brother Printers Example

If you want to test out the printer package or add new features, use this project to test the features or to play around
with the package. 

## Prerequisites 

1. Make sure you have yarn or npm installed
2. Make sure you have cocoapods installed
3. You may need the react-native-cli

## Getting started

To run this project use the following commands.

1. `$ yarn` or `$ npm i`
2. `$ cd ios;pod install`
3. `$ react-native run-ios`

## Best way to test with iOS

Open up the `example.xcworkspace` file in xcode. Then run the project in xcode on any simulator or physical device. 

To edit the base module files, in the xcode file explorer, go to -> Pods -> Development Pods -> 
react-native-brother-printers. You will then find the contents of the ios folder. You will need to rerun the project
in xcode every time you edit the content of these files.
